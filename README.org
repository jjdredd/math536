* Homework
  This repository contains the part of the homework that needed to
  be programmed.
* Repository structure
  - hw1.cpp, hw2.cpp, hw3.cpp, hw4.cpp and hw5.cpp - main sources for homework.
  - include/ - headers.
  - sbms/ - Symmetric Banded Matrix Storage class and algorithms to work
    on them (Cholesky and SOR solvers)
  - cg/ - Compact Storage class and algorithms for it. Mainly Conjugate
    Gradients (CG) and with preconditioner (CGWPC).
  - util/ - utilities mainly for vectors.
  - test/ - various tests and helper programs.
  - plot_script/ - gnuplot scripts.
* Building
  "make" will build everything and make *.elf executable files for each
  homework assignement.
* Running
  - main executables print most information to stdout.
  - hw1.elf outputs a plot of convergence rate over omega in "conv.txt"
  - hw2.elf outputs a plot of convergence rate and ln(error) over ln(h)
    in "conv_2.txt"
  - hw3.elf outputs "hw3_%f.txt" where %f is the Courant number
  - hw4.elf outputs the solution of problem 1 in hw4_prob1_sln.txt
    and problem 2 in hw4_prob2_sln_%f where %f is timestep k.
  - hw5.elf outputs ln(error) vs ln(h) plot in hw5_errors.txt.
  - plotting scripts must be run in the same directory as plot files
    generated by main executables (in the root directory of repository)
    "gnuplot plot_script/<script>.gpl"
